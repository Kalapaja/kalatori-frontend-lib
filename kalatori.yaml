  title: Kalatori — non-custodial Polkadot payments gateway
  description: |-
    Kalatori daemon API. Allows any compatible eCommerce plugin to create and monitor the payment status of its orders.

    Each order is used to derive a unique Polkadot address (using account derivation paths), which is used to map payment to the particular order ID.

    This API supports both **embedded** and **offsite** payment modes, where _embedded_ widget only talks to the shop's backend
    (which where necessary proxies the requests to the Kalatori daemon), while _offsite_ being a static page (hosted by either the daemon itself
    or on a CDN) which talks to the daemon directly via a namespace-separated public endpoint `/public/v2`.

  version: 2.1.0

paths:
  /v2/order/{orderId}:

      description: |-
        This endpoint idempotently derives and address and initializes payment monitoring for the specified amount

        The request method is POST, so no intermediaries would be caching responses;
        `orderID` is included into the path to allow some http-proxy level manipulation, like adding a prefix for the specific shop on successful auth.

        All other parameters are passed in a JSON payload
      parameters:

                    Amount (in selected currency; denominated, **not** in Plancks) to be paid. After reaching this amount Kalatori will initiate a payout
                    to the destination address and will report the order as paid to the shop.

                    This parameter can be skipped on subsequent requests, in which case the previous amount will be used.
                    If skipped in the original request, error 400 will be returned.
                  type: number
                  example: 17.99

                currency:

                    Currency (human-readable ticker, one of the values listed in the `/status::supported_currencies`) specifying the currency to wait for the payment in.

                    If no currency is specified, but `amount` is present, server will return error 400.
                  type: string
                  example: "USDC"

                callback:
                  description: |-
                    URL to be called when the order is paid.
                    The URL will receive a POST request with 'OrderStatus'-compliant JSON object on each transaction reaching (or leaving) this order's payment account.

                    If omitted in the initial request, there will be no callback URL set for the order.
                    If omitted in subsequent requests, the previous callback URL will be used; if the callback URL is different, the previous one will be replaced.
                    Set the callback URL to an empty string to remove the callback URL.
                  type: string
                  format: uri
                  example: "https://api.shop.example.com/webhooks/kalatori/daemon_callback?order=12345&hmac=055f479a461db45d02d6ec192de7f4a3"

      description: |-
        A separate payment status endpoint, to be exposed publicly and consumed by the "offsite payment" static frontent.
        It uses payment_account parameter to identify the order, instead of orderId, to prevent potential enumeration attacks.

        This endpoint is located separately, to allow easy http-level filtering and CORS setup on the inevitable http(s) middleware.

        _Note to implementers_: this endpoint **SHOULD NOT** include the `callback` URL in the response object, to avoid
        leaking potentially sensitive details (authentication parameters, internal IP addresses etc) of the shop backend to the frontend.

        _Note to implementers_: this endpoint should respond with `200` for a reasonable time after the order's finalization, since
        intermittent network issues might prevent the frontend from receiving the `redirect_url` in time, breaking the flow.

        The daemon is expected to mark the order as `failed` after a certain (customizable) amount of time passed;
        it will stop proactively monitoring such a payment address for any further transactions.

        Since it's possible that the payment will still arrive after such a long delay, the shop admin can
        use this endpoint to manually initiate a full scan of the order's payment address history.
        The scan is expected to be asynchronous and will use the callback URL to report the results.

          description: |-
            If our shop requires a separately-hosted payment page (for an "offsite payments" flow,
            similarly to what [Shopify does](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/payments/processing-overview#offsite-payments)), this URL should be used to redirect the user to the payment page.

            This page is expected to be fully static, bundled with the daemon and either served by the daemon itself or put elsewhere
            on CDN; this behaviour is customizable in the daemon config, and hosting the payment page externally would automatically set up
            all the necessary CORS headers for the `/public/v2/payment` endpoint.

            _Note to implementers_: our payment page uses `payment_account` to identify the order, instead of order ID.
            This is done to prevent order IDs being exposed (and potentially manipulated) in the frontend.\
            In order to render the full UI state on that page instantly (without querying the daemon's API first),
            it's advised to add the `amount` and `currency` to the URL as query parameters, and to use them to pre-fill
            the payment form (later to be updated from the daemon's API response, for the consistency's sake).

        redirect_url:
          type: string

            When used in the "offsite payments" mode, daemon will notify the shop backend about the payment status changes
            via the callback URL. The shop backend is then expected to return the redirect URL for the frontend to redirect
            the user to. This is an optional field which is set to that URL as soon as it's received from the shop backend.

            _Note to implementers_: it's assumed that the offline payments frontend will redirect to this URL as soon as it's set,
            via Javascript. Further interactions with the `/public/v2/payment/` endpoint are not guaranteed, since the order might
            get archived after successful withdrawal.
